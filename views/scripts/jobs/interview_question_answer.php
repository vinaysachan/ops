When we use the GET method all information is displayed on address bar. If can sent up to 1024 of data using GET method so it is good to use only when we are working with small scale applications and data is not that much sensitive. If we talk about POST method, No information will be displayed on address bar and we can send up to 2 mb of data using POST method. This limit can also extend further if required.
