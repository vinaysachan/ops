                        Welcome to the world of PHP, one of the Web's most popular programming languages. According to Netcraft , PHP was running on more than <a target="blank" href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2013/01/31/php-just-grows-grows.html">244 million Web SItes and  2.1M IP addresses in January 2013 </a>.

                    <div class="mt5">
                        The first version of PHP was named Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) when it was released by <a target="blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf">Rasmus Lerdorf</a> in 1995.<br>
                        <span class="text-danger bolder">PHP 1 </span>can still be downloaded today from <a target="blank" href="http://museum.php.net/">museum.php.net</a>.
                        Weighing in at only 26 kilobytes in size, php-108.tar.gz is diminutive by today's standards, yet it was capable of allowing users to implement guestbooks and other form-processing applications.<br>
                        <span class="text-danger bolder">PHP 2</span> introduced built-in support for accessing databases, cookie handling, and user-defined functions. It was released in 1997, and by the following year, around 1% of sites on the internet were using PHP.

                    <div class="mt5">
                        <span class="text-danger bolder">PHP 3.0 </span> was the first release to closely resemble today's incarnation of PHP. A rewrite of the underlying parser by <a target="blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andi_Gutmans">Andi Gutmans</a> and <a target="blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeev_Suraski">Zeev Suraski</a> led to what was arguably a different language; accordingly, it was renamed to simply PHP, which was a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor". This was released in 1998 and the ease of extending the language played a large part in its tremendous success, as this aspect attracted dozens of developers to submit a variety of modules.

This led to the creation of the Zend Engine, which was used by PHP 4 when it was released in 2000. As well as offering better performance, <span class="text-danger bolder">PHP 4</span> could be used with more web servers, supported HTTP sessions, output buffering and several new language constructs.<br> By September 2001, Netcraft's Web Server Survey found 1.8M sites running PHP.
